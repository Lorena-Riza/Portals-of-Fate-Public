  - You keep walking around...
  - Do you want something?
  - Depends.
  - What are you after? Actually no, I don't want to know. It's you, so it's sure
    trouble.
  - Tell you what. I'll help you if you can answer this question.
  - What is the purpose of the crossguard on a sword?
  - Fine... What do you want?
  - The king wasn't mistaken. You really are a fool!
  - Funny, but no.

    and the star.
  - The lilies grow in water. Think about that.
  - I helped enough. Now my only duty is to guard the door.
  - How should I know? Do I seem like the brainy type?
  - But witches on broomsticks? That's ridiculous!
  - I helped enough. Now my only duty is to guard the door.
  - Then leave. You've got nothing to do here.
